  <title>Zohran-Mart Primed to Succeed?</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>

<figcaption>Visual branding for Zohran compaign, to be carried over into retail operation?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I observe that one of the hard parts of running a competitive business is getting customers in the door.</p>
<p>I observe that having a strong brand, social media following, etc is a great asset in getting customers in the door.</p>
<p>I observe that the proposed NYC-run grocery stores which Zohran campaigned on are likely to be understood, both by supporters and critics, as an extension of the man himself.</p>
<p>I observe that the Mamdani campaign was highly successful, leveraging a strong social media strategy and visual branding into an improbable win.</p>
<p>I conclude that Zohran-Mart has a better chance of successful operation than perhaps most of my colleagues are willing to consider.</p>
<p>The obvious point that my fellow economists will raise against my conclusion is that, lacking a profit motive, the government-run stores will be unlikely to achieve the necessary level of cost containment.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in economics that says that state-run enterprises cannot operate efficiently, the standard result is rather that competitive pressures create a selection effect where most privately run enterprises operating at a given point in time will be operating efficiently, because they are the ones who are surviving.</p>
<p>It is true that grocery stores tend to operate thin profit margins, but this partially reflects that it is ultimately a somewhat simple business. I envision Zohran-Mart as an Aldi-style minimalist discount retailer, with perhaps a visual upgrade borrowing from the design sensibility which was on display in the campaign.</p>
<p>Trips to Zohran-Mart will almost certainly be cataloged and posted on social media, with a level of interest that will surely be the envy of every other grocer operating in the NYC area. This could of course be a liability if the stores are poorly run. But if the Mayor can manage to poach sufficient talent from the private sector to do a respectable job with the state-run option, I think it is entirely possible that the stores turn out to be a success.</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up? Most Mamdani commentary I have seen from people I respect has included passing, knee-jerk style derogatory comments about the absurdity of the NYC-run grocery idea. I worry about the profession losing yet further credibility in the eyes of the public if Zohran-Mart turns out to be a highly visible success story. No doubt this could lend cover to his other, much more troubling positions on other issues such as housing.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am overthinking it. But consider this my bold prediction for 2026, we will see if I can come up with any others before the year is out.</p>

  <title>LEAVES</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I am told that falling leaves symbolize transition. This may be so. But that does little to alleviate the distinct displeasure with which I face my new duty to rake and bag the leaves on my one-third acre property now that Hannah and I have become the proud owners of a lot with an established Oak in the backyard.</p>
<p>I remain unclear as to why this activity is at all necessary. I had been under the impression that the leaves would, left alone, begin to decompose at some point. But perhaps not quickly enough, and apparently there is also some concern about the ability of the turf underneath to survive.</p>
<p>If you ask me on a conceptual level whether I would benefit from being more connected to the land, I would be moderately, naively inclined to say yes. Faced with the reality of bagging leaves on an unseasonably warm November day yesterday, I am not so sure.</p>

</div>
<p>I have been undergoing some transitions of my own, and I had been considering the possibility of gardening as a new hobby, but this experience makes me reconsider whether that is wise. I never did especially like to go outside as a child, as an adult that has changed somewhat, and I like to imagine a version of myself that spends long hours in my garden, but I’m deeply uncertain about whether that is a realistic picture of myself.</p>
<p>There are plenty more leaves to which I must turn my attention this weekend, we will see whether I can not find some joy in it; I think the trick will be to do it in the morning before it heats up too much.</p>

  <title>Forays into Classical</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/bach partita no 2.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>As the Fall semester has progressed, I have found myself making more time for music, and taking my music in new and unexpected directions. Below I am sharing one of my favorite recent experiments, which involves Bach’s second violin Partita being voiced by a Bitwig Grid patch with some heavily modulated wavetable synthesis and delay effects. I really like the rhythmic effect achieved by the system of interlocked and cross-modulated tempo-synced LFO’s that are present in this patch. The delay lines give everything some bounce.</p>
<p>As I engage in these experiments, I do have the recurring thought that I am doing something sacrilegious, but I am simply having too much fun to stop. Using MIDI sequences from classical music gives me strong source material to build patches around. It also liberates me from having to think about crafting a linear structure, which seems to be anathema to me. I do find that there are some moments in the music I am producing where the effects created by my patches are clashing with the progression of the composition I am using, but I am too overjoyed by the other moments where the patch and the composition complement one another to worry about the imperfections at this juncture.</p>
<p>I have also experimented with adding layers of percussion to this music, and that does not feel good to me at all, but adding rhythmic elements through tempo-synced modulation is very nice.</p>
<p>I will share more in the near future, and I hope more generally to revive the blog.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I had a wonderful 30th birthday party yesterday, thank you to all who attended, and to those who were unable to make it I hope to see you soon.</p>
<p>I do not necessarily feel much older. I am however very much looking forward to the future: in case anyone had not yet heard, I am joining the economics faculty at Georgia College.</p>
<p>I have released some music lately, I put it on streaming but I think going forward I will just have it here on the website.</p>

  <title>President’s Day Update</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/weekend-update-1/Presidents day 2025.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Well, despite rumors to the contrary, the blog lives on in 2025.</p>
<p>I continue to reside in Pinellas County, Florida, and despite attempts to escape it does appear at this point that this arrangement will continue into the foreseeable future, however short that may have now become. In any case I am presently enjoying a rare cool evening, with the promise of more to come soon, so I can pretend for a moment that the long Summer is not so menacingly imminent.</p>
<p>The economics career remains presently unchanged, I am a full time researcher moonlighting as an educator. I am thinking that the blog may become an outlet for some pedagogical material, since I simply have nowhere better to put such material.</p>
<p>Musically, I have been turning away from the DAW (Bitwig) lately in favor of practicing an instrument: the <a href="https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument">Linnstrument</a>. Piano keyboard meets 8 string bass guitar, I am having a lot of fun with it, and have been more consistent in practicing than I ever was able to be with the keyboard. An underrated feature is that it accommodates a strap to be worn like a guitar, which for some reason makes me much more inclined to use it.</p>
<p>Economic uncertainty has been deterring me from booking travel aside from work travel, though Hannah has some trips in the works. As things firm up over the next few months, so may our travel agenda. So far we are on a 2 year streak with Transatlantic trips, hopefully we can make it a third.</p>
<p>I may have finally managed to become a morning person again, which is what you really ought to be when you live a short walk from brilliant sunrise views.</p>

  <title>New EP Out Now</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I am releasing some tracks produced throughout the course of this year, some were done on my old Ableton setup and some on the new Bitwig setup, I believe all include the analog Eurorack gear I got in Scotland on the Honeymoon. Available now on Soundcloud and eventually on other streaming platforms as well.</p>
<p>By the way I am taking keyboard lessons now and hope to produce some stuff more in the Western 12TET tradition, and also to collaborate more instead of doing this all at my home studio alone.</p>

  <title>I Switched to Bitwig</title>

<figcaption>My first Bitwig Grid Patch</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With Labor day fast approaching I thought it was time to post again. Life has gone on mostly smoothly, I am on the job market which is always fun, and in the meantime I have made some fun adjustments. I posted <a href="https://zandergordan.com/posts/maxmsp/beginnings-with-max.html">previously</a> about trying to learn Max/MSP, and I struggled quite a bit with this endeavor. I had heard of Bitwig and it’s Grid, and eventually decided to sell my Push and give it a try. I’m so glad I did!</p>
<p>My early efforts with Bitwig revolved around integrating my fledlging hardware modular setup with the Grid, which is straightfoward and rewarding to do. But this weekend I finally decided to tackle a more ambitious project, which I originally was trying to do in Max/MSP. It is a synth patch that I refer to as an “Auto Tremolo MPE Organ.” It incorporates 3 dimensions of MPE sensitivity per voice, X Y and Z. X maps to pitch as usual, and Z to overall volume, but Y deviates from its normal use as a “timbre” control and instead affects the rate of an LFO that is hooked into the VCA to give a Tremolo effect. Below is a demo of what is possible with this configuration:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1899699066%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5LlfBk93vzf&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/zandergordan" title="Zander Gordan" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Zander Gordan</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zandergordan/auto-organ-demo-2024-08-18-1735/s-5LlfBk93vzf" title="Auto Organ Demo 2024 - 08 - 18 1735" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Auto Organ Demo 2024 - 08 - 18 1735</a></div>
<p>Note that both the Y and Z dimensions of control are affecting volume. In other words, the effect I achieve here could theoretically be achieved by a skilled player simply manipulating the Z dimension in a rhythmic fashion. But I doubt I personally could achieve the sound that I do with this configuration without the LFO-enabled auto tremolo. And there is still some room to route the Y and Z controls to additional destinations to achieve some deeper control over tone for an even more expressive patch. But before going down that route I simply want to explore what is possible compositionally, the demo above is just a black key jam that I threw together with minimal effort. Below is the preset in case anyone ever wants to try it themselves.</p>
<p><a href="MPE Auto Tremolo Organ.bwpreset">Download Preset</a></p>
<p>Overall I can not thank the Bitwig team enough for their efforts in creating this intuitive virtual modular environment, I really struggle to express how much simpler it was to achieve my vision with this system compared to my struggles earlier trying to learn Max/MSP. I am sure Max has it’s place, especially in providing greater flexibility for full-time music technologists, but as a hobbyist finding time for music around the demands of a full time career I think the Grid is truly brilliant in its simplicity and accessibility.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Happy Memorial Day!</p>
<p>There is nothing much to report around here. In many places throughout America today will mark the “start of Summer”, but here in Pinellas County the long Summer has already begun some weeks ago, and I do not expect reprieve until, optimistically, Halloween.</p>
<p>Amid the heat, I have mostly been sheltering inside, though we did manage to get a little sunburnt earlier this weekend. The twilight hours should in principle be quite nice right now, were it not for the bugs. Though we in any case try to enjoy them a bit.</p>
<p>All creative pursuits except dancing have been put on the backburner for now, but we will see if the Summer does not provide some opportunities to return to them.</p>

<figcaption>Me in Iceland</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Most notably, we have returned from Iceland. The hot dogs are nothing special despite supposedly containing some amount of lamb, but represent an oasis of value in an otherwise high COL country: I had 5 over 6 days. Early April is a “shoulder season” but I thought it was ideal in providing the “ice” in Iceland while still being easy to navigate. Hannah wants to go back in Summer, but I fear the crowds.</p>
<p>My fitness routine has shifted to consisting almost entirely of freestyle dance for cardio and functional strength, while traditional strength training has been relegated to “someday.” The scale approves of the shift but my legs are in a perpetual state of soreness.</p>
<p>The Bible study has taken a backseat to Norse mythology, which I picked up a couple books on while in the Keflavik airport on the way home from Iceland. I consider these essentially fungible “wisdom literature” sources. I had not realized what a selected subsample of the myths were preserved, relative to the Greek ones that I studied in high school.</p>
<p>There is unfortunately no news in regard to music; the next likely release is DFO vol 2. Max/MSP progress has ground to a halt, but in the meantime I have developed concrete ideas I want to execute on that should ultimately motivate me to resume that course of study.</p>
<p>I have a new-found appreciation of candlelight.</p>
<p>Everton secured safety some weeks ago. Tomorrow they have the potential to play spoiler if Man City can not pull out a win, but I probably can not even be bothered to watch. It is too early to say how the Braves season looks, but the fact they currently trail the Phillies is cause for significant distress in our household. I do not follow FSU off-season developments but hopefully things are going well, as I understand it the rules are now changed so that an ACC championship will be sufficient to put us in the expanded playoffs, regardless of the opinions of any committee.</p>

  <title>Weekend Update #2</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Happy St.&nbsp;Patrick’s day, for another 3 hours at least. As I begin writing, Atlanta United is about to wrap up at 2-0 victory over Orlando, getting a healthy start to the 2024 campaign.</p>
<p>The MLB season will begin on Tuesday, with a break from tradition as the Dodgers and Padres play a 2 game series in Korea, before Opening Day. Hannah will be waking up to watch these games at 6am eastern, I will have to make a game-time decision as to whether I am willing to give up my beauty sleep.</p>
<p>I finished reading my last great book some time ago, which was the Briggs translation of War and Peace. I’ve decided to embark on a new literary undertaking, which is to get a study bible (HarperCollins) and some other related works and begin familiarizing myself with the Christian tradition. This obviously is a long-term endeavor, and in my opinion not likely to be terribly rewarding on its own, and so my plan is to intersperse this learning with revisiting some of the classics already familiar to me, including especially Shakespeare, and the American Transcendentalists, and to try to appreciate aspects of these works which I may have not when I read them in High School with little to no familiarity with the Bible.</p>

<p>I have collected the odds from Fanduel on each MLB team’s over/under for total regular season wins, and the odds of the team winning the world series. How do these correlate?</p>

<p>It seems that there is pretty much a log-linear inverse relationship between expected win total (technically an over under is not the same thing as an expected value, but I will use the terms interchangeably) and your winnings from betting the team to win the world series. Notably, for the worst teams, you do not win as much for betting on them as you might expect, no doubt the oddsmakers want to limit their potential downside from those who are attracted to the most outrageous bets.</p>
<p>I think it may be useful also to convert the odds to break-even win probabilities:</p>

<p>Now we get a positive log-linear relationship, which is more intuitive. I will note that there really are not any extreme off-diagonal outliers here. A dot far up and to the left in this plot would represent a team “built for the playoffs”, that is having a much better chance of winning the World Series than their regular season projections would suggest. As far as Vegas is considered, there really are no such teams. The closest would be the Red Sox, with a 1.2% chance compared to the 0.8% chance of the Marlins, despite having the same expected wins 77.5 wins, or put another way the same chance of winning as the giants who have 81.5 expected wins.</p>
<p>So, are there any teams that are uniquely “built for the playoffs?” If you think there is, maybe you should bet on them to win it all. Otherwise, if “built for the playoffs” is just a verbose way of saying “good,” then maybe we should retire the phrase.</p>

  <title>It Has Happened</title>

  <description><![CDATA[

<p>AI has provided me with useful results. It only took over a year. I tried several times earlier last year, and never found it very useful.</p>
<p>What is notable about the current success is that I was asking it for some very basic advice about using the programming language Max. Whereas my priory inquiries had been about relatively advanced economics or R programming, which the AI did not seem capable of helping with.</p>
<p>Overall I am still not as convinced of how groundbreaking this stuff is as some people are, but I see clearly now that it is a great boon for learners and pedagogy, assuming that it can be relied upon to know its own limitations. A significant improvement over the previous method of searching for help in this context: googling keywords and praying for a well written forum post.</p>
<p>And yes, the inquiry was in service of creating my very own first original Max patch: a simple clocked random sampler, the core logic for which is now complete. I now simply need to learn the Max4Live components necessary to flesh out a user interface and i/o that is compatible with the Push 3.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>This evening I am embarking on something which I have not seriously considered since 2020: learning a new programming language. At that time I decided to learn the R language since it was the data analysis tool of choice among my new coworkers at NOAA, now I am learning Max MSP because it appears to be the tool of choice for a lot of people making weird electronic music.</p>
<p>I have been aware of Max for a long time, since at least 2011 I think. I may have even experimented with it at some point in late high school or early college. And since returning to Ableton Live to make music over the past year or so, I have used Max For Live devices, especially in recent months to interface between Ableton and my eurorack rig. In fact, this is precisely my motivator for learning the language: I want to make Max4Live devices that will augment the possibilities of my Eurorack + Push setup, without having to get a bigger eurorack case and amassing a larger collection of modules.</p>
<p>I am happy to see that there is now what seems to be a great resource for someone in my position, in the form of a Kadenze course. As I recall, the information available online for learning Max back 10-15 years ago was not particularly accessible, or anyway that is how I remember feeling at the time.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that yesterday evening I briefly looked into learning C++, with an eye to eventually using JUCE to do plugin development and learn DSP that way, but I think I am going to get a lot more fulfillment out of the limited time I have to devote to music stuff by going the Max route.</p>
<p>The screenshot above is from the first exercise of the Kadenze course, which is assembled step by step in the lesson videos, and the exercise is then to slightly modify the patch to change the behavior. It took me just a couple minutes to think of how to complete the exercise, and I learned a good bit in the process. Overall I am impressed with the pedagogy so far, and hope the rest of the class will be equally good.</p>

  <title>EBINLO Is Dead, Long Live EBINLO</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>

<p>I am now releasing music under the artist name Zander Gordan. The former name EBINLO was chosen at random, as something that could reasonably pass for a DJ/Producer moniker. Contrary to some suspicions, it was not an acronym. When I made the decision last year to make some music again for the first time in a long time, I was not ready to associate what I was doing with my own name and ego, so a disposable moniker was necessary for the sake of psychological distance. I am now more confident that this is something I intend to do for the long term, and it feels appropriate to release music going forward under my own name.</p>
<p>I am also switching to Soundcloud as my distributor for the time being, so my new tracks will be available there first before they are on Spotify et al.&nbsp;I just released a new track: I’m Sorry Babe But I Just Can’t Dance To This Chord Progression</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1750267074&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/zandergordan" title="Zander Gordan" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Zander Gordan</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zandergordan/sorry-babe-but-i-just-cant-dance-to-this-chord-progression" title="Sorry Babe But I Just Can't Dance To This Chord Progression" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Sorry Babe But I Just Can't Dance To This Chord Progression</a></div>
<p>It is my favorite little bit of modular mayhem yet: almost everything you hear in this track is the <a href="https://www.signalsounds.com/steady-state-fate-entity-ultra-perc-eurorack-percussion-module">SSF Ultra-Perc</a> being modulated 5 different ways, including at audio rates.</p>
<p>Here’s to many more releases to come!</p>

  <title>Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is: Superbowl Conspiracy Edition</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/superbowl-conspiracy/put-your-money.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>It is presently fashionable in some quarters to insist that today’s big game is rigged in favor of the Chiefs (the details do not bear repeating so I will leave it at that). With sports betting now legal in many jurisdictions across the US, I wonder what portion of people who hold this belief are interested in monetizing their insider knowledge.</p>
<p>I just checked my local sports betting app, and the odds ratios are 1.83 for the 49er’s and 2.00 for the Chiefs, meaning the 49ers are in fact slightly favored by Vegas, and the app is offering a double-or-nothing proposition for every dollar someone wagers on the Chiefs.</p>
<p>If you are 90+ percent sure that the game is rigged in favor of the Chiefs, what portion of your life savings should you be betting on this incredible chance to double your money instantly?</p>
<p>As a side note, I believe most betting operators have the home address of their customers, and perhaps even some other demographic data. I would love to see an analysis of how wagers for the Chiefs correlate at the voting precinct level with recent election results, among other things. But I do not think Vegas is known for being generous with their data, oh well…</p>

  <title>Ode to the Keytar</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/keytar/ode.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWFMi2ikK06W1stPUEl7rNqFqiXMNuAS/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
<p>Today I am packing up my keytar, to ship it off to it’s buyer. This is in fact the second keytar I have owned, having sold the first one back in I believe 2017. I have fond memories of both models, this one a Korg RK-100S2, which has microKORG-esque presets, and I love the ergonomics of the keytar, allowing me to riff on a melody while walking around my house absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately I just don’t think the keytar fits into my plans for the EBINLO project. I plan on using Eurorack sequencers to create the melodies for EBINLO songs, and frankly my keyboard skills were never all that impressive anyway.</p>
<p>I will at times miss the keytar, but in any case I think it will be best that I get used to using the pads on my Ableton Push for any melodic sequencing outside of the Eurorack; there’s just no need for a traditional keyboard in my current setup. As per my last post, I am down to just the modular and the Push, and I want to force myself to really focus on exploring that setup.</p>

  <title>First Eurorack Case Built</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/eurorack-groovebox/case-complete.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/eurorack-groovebox/mantis.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Today I’ve finally finished doing something that I started last year: building out my first eurorack case. It started with the Moog Mother-32 and DFAM combo, which I got when I visited the Moog factory / flagship store during my bachelor party last year. I then added a few modules when I visited Scotland on the honeymoon and made a stop at <a href="https://www.signalsounds.com">Signal Sounds</a> in Glasgow. Since then I have made another order from Signal Sounds, and I asked my family for a couple modules for Christmas, and now I have the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/2456186" class="uri">https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/2456186</a></p>
<p>In addition to the modular, I also picked up the Ableton Push 3 last year. I used to have a Push 2 but sold it years ago as I never used it. Earlier this week, I was thinking about selling the Push 3 for the same reason. But I’ve decided I’m going to unplug the Push from the computer and get used to doing everything in the standalone mode. I think the learning curve will be steep getting used to doing things on the Push, but it will ultimately be better than if I just keep using the keyboard and mouse for everything.</p>
<p>The Expert Sleepers ES-3 and ES-6 modules in the Eurorack connect to the Push through ADAT, and I use the Push as a mixer, as a sampler, for effects, and for LFO’s through the CV Tools add-on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/eurorack-groovebox/music setup.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So that’s the whole setup, and I think I will keep it this way probably at least through the early Summer, and try to make a few tracks with this configuration. Perhaps it is optimistic to think I can abstain from adding on to the eurorack for that long.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets from me jamming on the modular (no Ableton except for mixing):</p>

  <title>Amend Those Teenage Labor Bills</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/teenage-labor/amend-those.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/teenage-labor/ff87b992-6c1b-497b-8584-258990c146ed_550x364.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=78634">Florida HB 49 (2024)</a>&nbsp;should be amended to retain the restrictions on hours of work for 16 and 17 year olds, but clarify and expand the scope for existing exemptions granted by the schools. There should be a simple, objective process by which a high school student on track to graduate (ie 2.0 GPA, passing EOC's, etc.) can get a waiver to work without the hours restrictions, so long as their academic progress continues apace. Furthermore, schools should maintain a registry of students requesting and receiving such waivers, with such registry being shared with the FLDOE and academic partners for research purposes. In this way we can track the outcomes of students working extended hours, and advance the state of knowledge on the effect of teenage labor force participation on long run outcomes.</p>
<p>HB 49 seeks to change some of the labor laws for teenagers, perhaps most notably by lifting restrictions on the hours of work for 16 and 17 year olds, which according to the staff analysis of the bill (p9)&nbsp;includes the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before 6:30 a.m. or after 11:00 p.m.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 8 hours in any one day when school is scheduled the following day.</p></li>
<li><p>When school is in session, more than 30 hours in any one week.</p></li>
<li><p>During school hours on any school day, if not enrolled in a career education program.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 6 consecutive days in any one week.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 4 hours continuously without an interval of at least 30 minutes for a meal period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One aspect of these restrictions which I have not seen discussed in the media&nbsp;is the various exemptions to them which already exist under current law. As per the same staff analysis, those exemptions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Minors 16 and 17 years-of-age who have graduated from high school or received a high school equivalency diploma.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors who are within the compulsory school attendance age limit who hold a valid certificate of exemption issued by the school superintendent or his or her designee pursuant to the provisions of s. 1003.21(3), F.S.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors enrolled in a public educational institution who qualify on a hardship basis such as economic necessity or family emergency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such determination must be made by the school superintendent or his or her designee, and a waiver of hours must be issued to the minor and the employer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Children in domestic service in private homes, children employed by their parents, or pages in the Florida Legislature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I see it, these existing exemptions reflect the fact that not all teenagers are the same, and a one-size-fits-all policy that places the same restrictions on the labor supply of all teenagers is not desirable. The first exemption, for students who graduate or get their GED early, seems especially reasonable to me. The second and third exemptions, in which waivers may be granted with the intervention of the superintendent or their designee, are the focus of my post. I have only been able to gather limited information about these waivers, a number of counties have webpages providing details about how these waivers may be obtained, including Escambia, Volusia, Brevard and Alachua.</p>
<p>It seems in these districts there is generally an administrative staff member who is responsible for signing off on these waivers, which require a significant amount of paperwork, and involve a subjective assessment by administrative staff as to whether granting the waiver is in the best interests of the students. Therefore, I can understand the desire, expressed in HB 49, to do away with these restrictions so that this waiver process is no longer needed. However, I think a smarter option is to streamline the process for obtaining a waiver, such that the waiver is granted automatically as long as a student is on track to graduate, meaning they are maintaining a 2.0 GPA, not be excessively tardy or absent, etc. If a students' grades dropped, the waiver would be automatically revoked, The advantages of streamlining the waiver system, as opposed to doing away with the restrictions entirely, are two-fold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It would ensure that students' education is not hampered by their work schedule. Those opposed to HB 49 imagine students working long hours or overnight shifts, coming in to school tired and not performing well in school, potentially even dropping out. By maintaining a waiver system tied to staying on track to graduate, we could avoid the worst case scenarios that might play out under a full repeal.</p></li>
<li><p>It would create a registry of students who are working without the hours restrictions. By sharing this registry with trusted research partners, and keeping track of students working under waivers through graduation and beyond, we could learn more about the effects of teenage labor force participation on these young people's lives.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I view the second point as especially important. The fact is, we know very little about what is the best way for young people to be spending their time during crucial formative years as they transition to adulthood and enter the workforce, particularly given the rapidly changing nature of our economy. Personally, I think extensive participation in the labor force at a young age may be beneficial for some teenagers, especially those who might, for instance, go on to form their own businesses. In the media coverage surrounding HB 49, one 16 year old named Logan Schulenberger is quoted as being in favor of the bill lifting the hours restrictions. Logan apparently works as a martial arts instructor, and so if that is his path then all the better for him to get experience early and advance his career in that field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For certain professions such as automotive technician, welder, farmer, etc. the schools operate vocational programs where students can earn school credits taking classes about their profession, and get work experience through an employer affiliated with the school, but these programs are limited in scope and not applicable to many students. While I certainly support expanding vocational education as an alternative to the college preparatory track which I think many agree has become oversaturated, having a waiver system for students to work full time schedules or flexible schedules while in school is another viable option for expanding the range of paths students may take as they transition into the workforce.</p>
<p>Only by keeping track of the students who avail themselves of these waivers, and seeing how things play out for them, can we learn more about what the actual effect of increased high school labor force participation is. HB 49 as written would not provide us with the opportunity to gather this valuable information, and additionally it would not provide any safeguards against extended working hours adversely impacting students' academic outcomes, which is why the bill should be amended before advancing any further in the 2024 session.</p>
