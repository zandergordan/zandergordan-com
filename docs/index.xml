  <title>First Eurorack Case Built</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>

<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/eurorack-groovebox/mantis.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Today I’ve finally finished doing something that I started last year: building out my first eurorack case. It started with the Moog Mother-32 and DFAM combo, which I got when I visited the Moog factory / flagship store during my bachelor party last year. I then added a few modules when I visited Scotland on the honeymoon and made a stop at <a href="https://www.signalsounds.com">Signal Sounds</a> in Glasgow. Since then I have made another order from Signal Sounds, and I asked my family for a couple modules for Christmas, and now I have the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/2456186" class="uri">https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/2456186</a></p>
<p>In addition to the modular, I also picked up the Ableton Push 3 last year. I used to have a Push 2 but sold it years ago as I never used it. Earlier this week, I was thinking about selling the Push 3 for the same reason. But I’ve decided I’m going to unplug the Push from the computer and get used to doing everything in the standalone mode. I think the learning curve will be steep getting used to doing things on the Push, but it will ultimately be better than if I just keep using the keyboard and mouse for everything.</p>
<p>The Expert Sleepers ES-3 and ES-6 modules in the Eurorack connect to the Push through ADAT, and I use the Push as a mixer, as a sampler, for effects, and for LFO’s through the CV Tools add-on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/eurorack-groovebox/music setup.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So that’s the whole setup, and I think I will keep it this way probably at least through the early Summer, and try to make a few tracks with this configuration. Perhaps it is optimistic to think I can abstain from adding on to the eurorack for that long.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets from me jamming on the modular (no Ableton except for mixing):</p>

  <title>Amend Those Teenage Labor Bills</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/teenage-labor/amend-those.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/teenage-labor/ff87b992-6c1b-497b-8584-258990c146ed_550x364.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=78634">Florida HB 49 (2024)</a>&nbsp;should be amended to retain the restrictions on hours of work for 16 and 17 year olds, but clarify and expand the scope for existing exemptions granted by the schools. There should be a simple, objective process by which a high school student on track to graduate (ie 2.0 GPA, passing EOC's, etc.) can get a waiver to work without the hours restrictions, so long as their academic progress continues apace. Furthermore, schools should maintain a registry of students requesting and receiving such waivers, with such registry being shared with the FLDOE and academic partners for research purposes. In this way we can track the outcomes of students working extended hours, and advance the state of knowledge on the effect of teenage labor force participation on long run outcomes.</p>
<p>HB 49 seeks to change some of the labor laws for teenagers, perhaps most notably by lifting restrictions on the hours of work for 16 and 17 year olds, which according to the staff analysis of the bill (p9)&nbsp;includes the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before 6:30 a.m. or after 11:00 p.m.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 8 hours in any one day when school is scheduled the following day.</p></li>
<li><p>When school is in session, more than 30 hours in any one week.</p></li>
<li><p>During school hours on any school day, if not enrolled in a career education program.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 6 consecutive days in any one week.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 4 hours continuously without an interval of at least 30 minutes for a meal period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One aspect of these restrictions which I have not seen discussed in the media&nbsp;is the various exemptions to them which already exist under current law. As per the same staff analysis, those exemptions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Minors 16 and 17 years-of-age who have graduated from high school or received a high school equivalency diploma.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors who are within the compulsory school attendance age limit who hold a valid certificate of exemption issued by the school superintendent or his or her designee pursuant to the provisions of s. 1003.21(3), F.S.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors enrolled in a public educational institution who qualify on a hardship basis such as economic necessity or family emergency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such determination must be made by the school superintendent or his or her designee, and a waiver of hours must be issued to the minor and the employer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Children in domestic service in private homes, children employed by their parents, or pages in the Florida Legislature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I see it, these existing exemptions reflect the fact that not all teenagers are the same, and a one-size-fits-all policy that places the same restrictions on the labor supply of all teenagers is not desirable. The first exemption, for students who graduate or get their GED early, seems especially reasonable to me. The second and third exemptions, in which waivers may be granted with the intervention of the superintendent or their designee, are the focus of my post. I have only been able to gather limited information about these waivers, a number of counties have webpages providing details about how these waivers may be obtained, including Escambia, Volusia, Brevard and Alachua.</p>
<p>It seems in these districts there is generally an administrative staff member who is responsible for signing off on these waivers, which require a significant amount of paperwork, and involve a subjective assessment by administrative staff as to whether granting the waiver is in the best interests of the students. Therefore, I can understand the desire, expressed in HB 49, to do away with these restrictions so that this waiver process is no longer needed. However, I think a smarter option is to streamline the process for obtaining a waiver, such that the waiver is granted automatically as long as a student is on track to graduate, meaning they are maintaining a 2.0 GPA, not be excessively tardy or absent, etc. If a students' grades dropped, the waiver would be automatically revoked, The advantages of streamlining the waiver system, as opposed to doing away with the restrictions entirely, are two-fold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It would ensure that students' education is not hampered by their work schedule. Those opposed to HB 49 imagine students working long hours or overnight shifts, coming in to school tired and not performing well in school, potentially even dropping out. By maintaining a waiver system tied to staying on track to graduate, we could avoid the worst case scenarios that might play out under a full repeal.</p></li>
<li><p>It would create a registry of students who are working without the hours restrictions. By sharing this registry with trusted research partners, and keeping track of students working under waivers through graduation and beyond, we could learn more about the effects of teenage labor force participation on these young people's lives.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I view the second point as especially important. The fact is, we know very little about what is the best way for young people to be spending their time during crucial formative years as they transition to adulthood and enter the workforce, particularly given the rapidly changing nature of our economy. Personally, I think extensive participation in the labor force at a young age may be beneficial for some teenagers, especially those who might, for instance, go on to form their own businesses. In the media coverage surrounding HB 49, one 16 year old named Logan Schulenberger is quoted as being in favor of the bill lifting the hours restrictions. Logan apparently works as a martial arts instructor, and so if that is his path then all the better for him to get experience early and advance his career in that field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For certain professions such as automotive technician, welder, farmer, etc. the schools operate vocational programs where students can earn school credits taking classes about their profession, and get work experience through an employer affiliated with the school, but these programs are limited in scope and not applicable to many students. While I certainly support expanding vocational education as an alternative to the college preparatory track which I think many agree has become oversaturated, having a waiver system for students to work full time schedules or flexible schedules while in school is another viable option for expanding the range of paths students may take as they transition into the workforce.</p>
<p>Only by keeping track of the students who avail themselves of these waivers, and seeing how things play out for them, can we learn more about what the actual effect of increased high school labor force participation is. HB 49 as written would not provide us with the opportunity to gather this valuable information, and additionally it would not provide any safeguards against extended working hours adversely impacting students' academic outcomes, which is why the bill should be amended before advancing any further in the 2024 session.</p>

  <title>Brilliant Business Idea #6739</title>

</div>
<p>On Jan 5 2019 I had a brilliant idea: a bar where the beer is served by trains on a model railroad.</p>
<p>Since then, I had not thought of this idea, until recently I was cleaning up the notes app in my phone. It seems as good of an idea today as it did 5 years ago.</p>
<p>So I looked it up, and what do you know, somebody beat me to the punch. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKnjXgUcO4c">Prague</a>, it’s called Vytopna, and it’s seemingly a hit with the tourists. I see some <a href="https://www.947wls.com/2017/06/19/chicago-is-getting-its-own-beer-train-marshmallow-restaurant-and-more-divvy-bikes/">reports</a> that the small Czech chain was supposed to expand into America via Chicago, but from what I can tell those plans never materialized. I think the concept would do very well in this country, and would certainly patronize any establishment that took up the concept, at least once.</p>
<p>One of these days I’ll have an idea that isn’t already taken.</p>

  <title>Year in Review 2023</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/review-2023/year-in-review-2023.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/review-2023/IMG_1806.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">The Scott Monument in Edinburgh, captured on my honeymoon</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I got married, visited the ancestral homeland (Scotland), and attended my first in-person academic conference in years (NAAFE). 2023 was the year I felt the pandemic move firmly into the rear view. Hopefully going forward I will maintain that momentum, especially in regards to travel, as I feel I have a few lost years to make up for.</p>
<p>What else can I say about 2023?</p>
<p>I watched a lot of sports. The only time I really felt invested was during the FSU football season, which saw them go undefeated until a horrific bowl game loss to UGA yesterday. Everton is doing better than last year, except that they are still in the relegation zone due to the draconian points deduction. Honestly I have not even watched that much soccer, maybe as the campaign continues my interest will intensify, especially if Everton are once again fighting for safety.</p>
<p>Since I watched a lot of sports (besides soccer), I also watched a lot of commercials. I believe I am relatively pro-commercial, at least compared to most people I know. Yet I have numerous gripes with the commercials I see. First and foremost: there simply is not enough variety. I see the same commercials again over and over, and I simply do not understand the economics of how that, in the current year, is the equilibrium. If you spend time on YouTube, you will see a much greater variety of ads, often linked to the topic of the video you are watching. Yet when watching sports, I am expected to watch the same ads over and over, mostly from insurance companies. Who selects insurance coverage on any other basis than getting a large number of quotes and selecting the best rate? And why is Shaq the spokesman for everything from pizza to cheap cruise vacations to printer ink (also for Icy-Hot, but at least that one makes sense, it is the only ad in which he actually, you know, plays basketball). In 2024, I need MLB Network to get it together and run ads from more than 8 companies.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">How many commercials can this guy do?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>2023 also brought a fair number of developments in the world of economics. Most notably, the US seems to have definitively achieved a “soft landing”: inflation has been driven down to manageable levels, with no recession in sight. Of course, don’t tell that to my mother, or vast numbers of other Americans, for whom I think the working definition of a recession is “a time in which myself and people I know are financially struggling”, which with elevated home prices, rents, and interest rates, encompasses a larger share of the population than the new phillips curve numbers would suggest.</p>
<p>Now about those home prices: is it a bubble? Most people in my profession seem to have come around to saying no. I was a bit of a holdout, and circa this Summer I thought the Case-Shiller index for some markets was showing signs of weakness, but the latest numbers do not bare that out. So seemingly, no, it is not a bubble, and yes, somehow, a 1000 sqft home older than my grandpa, in the neighborhood he grew up in, is now close to a half a million. I always thought Pinellas County was similar in its urban topography to Los Angeles, and now we are getting home prices to match. Here’s to remote work and telecommuting, and the flexibility it brings; with any luck 2024 may see me joining the hordes leaving their old familiar nests for cheaper pastures.</p>
<p>If we do decamp, I’ll need to find a place with a good sized backyard for my dog Cannoli. He’s getting older, and yet shows no signs of slowing down, except that he has firmly decided he does not like being picked up. I don’t know how we survived living in a 2nd floor apartment with him, at this point a fenced in backyard seems like an absolute must-have for him to run around. In a remarkable first, one of his Christmas 2022 gifts is going to survive into 2024, so perhaps he is learning to be more gentle. This year he got a gigantic buffalo horn, we will see how long that lasts, I give it 2 months tops.</p>
<p>I already made a post about my favorite music of the year, but I neglected to talk about my personal musical activities for the year. I adopted a new moniker, <a href="https://www.ebinlo.com">EBINLO</a>, and released a few pieces of music and some DJ mixes. Going forward I will keep posts about music stuff mostly segregated to the EBINLO blog, but will occasionally mention it here as well, especially if there are any major milestones to report. This year saw me acquire more gear than I ever have before, thanks to my decision to get into Eurorack. But I think it is working, the modular system keeps me motivated to create in a way that did not happen when working just in Ableton. In the back of my mind I always consider whether I should try to improve my piano skills as a way to improve my relationship with music-making, but probably I never will. I would say my biggest goal for music making in 2024 is to spend less time on sound design and more time on arrangement.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">My newest track includes the unprecedented use of inhale-scream vocals, which I may expand on in the future</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I didn’t dance enough this year! Probably I could say that about almost any year, but I think this year it was especially true. It’s so important to move around, and there’s no better way to move than with the music. I think I remain firmly committed to spontaneous, unchoreographed dancing, and I wonder what the current dance floor situation is like in the age of the TikTok dances.</p>
<p>Even the wedding, unfortunately, involved less dancing than I would have liked. Though there was I suppose by most people’s standards plenty of dancing. The wedding was mostly as nice as we could have hoped, and in fact we achieved our stated goal of being legally bound to one another, which is the important part. The cake, I am told, was very good, though I only got a single bite of it. The family seemed to enjoy themselves, and we are all very grateful that the extensive planning and coordinating is now done with.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize I would say: wedding good, Scotland better, economy debatable.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I listened to a lot of interesting music in 2023, although most of it actually was not new music, but rather older music from different genres and scenes that I had not previously explored very much, such as IDM from artists like <a href="https://squarepusher.bandcamp.com/album/feed-me-weird-things-remastered">Squarepusher</a> and <a href="https://plaid.bandcamp.com/album/feorm-falorx">Plaid</a>, old techno released off the <a href="https://kompakt.fm">Kompakt</a> label, and instrumental funk from artists like <a href="https://thebudosband.bandcamp.com/album/the-budos-band">The Budos Band</a>. In any case, I’ll mostly focus this post on music that actually came out this year, of which I also listened to plenty.</p>

  <title>New Florida Parks Resident Preference Policy</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/florida-parks-resident-preference/parks-preference.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I recently received an email from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection informing me that “Effective Jan.&nbsp;1, 2024, at noon Eastern time, only Florida residents may make reservations for cabins and RV, tent, boat and equestrian campsites 11 months in advance. Non-Florida residents will be able to make reservations 10 months in advance.”</p>
<p>This is the result of <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=76845&amp;SessionId=99#:~:text=CS%2FHB%20109%20%2D%20State%20Park%20Campsite%20Reservations&amp;text=State%20Park%20Campsite%20Reservations%3A%20Requires,specified%20information%20for%20advance%20reservations.">Florida 2023 HB 109</a>, signed into law back in May. I am not clear on whether I think this is a good or bad development. Selfishly speaking, it will make it slightly easier for me to get a booking at certain campsites, though I have not actually made such a booking since January 2022. On the other hand, I worry it may hurt our tourism industry. Thinking ahead, I also wonder whether similar laws being passed in other states could lead us to an unfortunate equilibrium where the best campsites in America are all for the exclusive use of in-state residents.</p>
<p>Regarding tourism impacts, I think it is worth noting that there has been some serious neglect in how this bill was handled in the state legislature: potential tourism impacts were declared to be essentially 0. In the legislature, bills undergo staff review, including an economic impact section, if you look at the links under the “staff analysis” section of the previous link, you can see that in 8 separate versions of the analysis of this bill, all declared that the impact of this bill on state and local government revenues would be none.</p>
<p>Let me say it is not obvious a priori whether this law would lead to a reduction or increase in sales tax revenues. That depends on a number of parameters, such as whether in-state residents or tourists tend to spend more on a given campsite trip, and whether tourists who are locked out of their preferred campsite due to the new rules subsequently cancel their trip entirely, or if they simply substitute to a different kind of trip, and if so how much money they spend on that substitute trip compared to their first choice trip. With those caveats in mind, and armed with 0 data on the question, let me say that my intuition is strongly that tourists tend to spend more than in-state residents, and that the new law will lead to a substantial reduction in tourist trips and consequently state sales tax revenues.</p>
<p>The fact that there is no amount of thought dedicated to this question in the official analysis of the law, and that the law still passed unanimously in both chambers, signals to me that in some cases the neurons simply are not firing in Tallahassee.</p>

  <title>On The Shohei Deal</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/on-shohei-deal/on-shohei-deal.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It is generally agreed that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. There are a number of reasons for this, the ones I would focus on are inflation, investments, and the value of spending money earlier in our life as opposed to when we are in our old age. Economists often speak of this idea by referring to the “time value of money.”</p>
<p>Given the last couple years of inflation we have experienced, I think everyone understands the time value of money in the sense that you could have bought more stuff for the same amount of money a few years ago than you could get now. But an even more fundamental aspect of the time value of money has to do with investment opportunities. If you can take your money and put it to productive use by running a business, or investing in someone elses business, then the profit that you generate while that business is running is the value created by having the money invested in the business. Thus even in an economy with little to no inflation, the time value of money means that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, because the dollar today can be invested to earn a financial return.</p>
<p>I want to talk about what the time value of money means for the recent deal bringing Shohei Ohtani across town to the LA Dodgers. The punchline is that what was initially announced as a $700 million, 10 year deal, is substantially less impressive than it sounds since the vast majority of the money will be received far in the future. Specifically, <a href="https://theathletic.com/5129506/2023/12/11/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-contract-deferrals/">we are now being told</a> that Shohei will receive only $2 million per year for the 10 years he plays under the new contract (2024-2033), and then will receive $68 million for ten years after (2034-2043). The Athletic article I link to above has this to say about the arrangement: “For the 10 years that he is to play for the Dodgers, then, Ohtani's deal could be thought of as being worth $46 million on average every year. But over the full 20-year lifespan of the deal — including the following 10 years when the deferrals are paid out, a time when Ohtani is no longer under contract with the team — he is to make a total of $700 million.”</p>
<p>I thought that this quote might be confusing to some baseball fans with limited economics and finance knowledge, which is the reason I wanted to make this post. Based on what I have written already, hopefully it is clear that the reason the deal can be thought of as only worth $46 million a year has to do with investments: Shohei would be much better off if they gave him the full $700 million immediately and then he could invest the money, or even if he was paid $70 million each year, as I initially thought when I first heard the news this weekend. But I want to provide some context about how exactly the $46 million figure was reached, and what it means for how you should think about this historic deal.</p>
<p>The $46 million figure quoted by The Athletic is what’s known in baseball as the average annual value (or AAV) of the contract, which may be a familiar term to baseball fans who follow the sport closely. In most contracts, the AAV is simply the average value of the contract, so a 2 year contract that paid $10 million in the first year and then $20 million in the second would have an AAV of $15 million. But the calculation becomes more complicated for the Shohei deal, because of the deferrals, or money that is paid after the year in which the player worked. In this case, the AAV is calculated using an economic concept known as Net Present Value (or NPV), which accounts for the time value of money.</p>
<p>NPV is defined as an amount of money that you could give someone right now, that would be equivalent to the cash flow received over time, given certain assumptions about how the money could be invested. Let me illustrate this with the simplest example possible: say that you have a high yield savings account that pays 10% interest per year, so if you put $100 in it on New Years Day, then at the end of the year you will have $110. In this case, if someone offers you a contract that pays out $110 at the end of the year, you would be just as well off going with a different contract that paid $100 at the start of the year. Even though the dollar value of one contract is higher, their NPV is the same due to the time value of money.</p>
<p>In baseball, the contracts are much more complex, and pay out different amounts of money over various time periods. Shohei’s deal is particularly complex because of the deferrals. But the core concept of NPV is the same when analyzing these contracts no matter how complex they are: the NPV of the contract is the amount that the player could be paid immediately, which would be worth the same as the money they receive over the course of the years of their contract, when we assume that the player could invest their money to earn a certain interest rate.</p>
<p>For those who like numbers and formulas, here is the formula for NPV (others can skip over this):</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ANPV%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bt=0%7D%5ET%20%5Cfrac%7BP_t%7D%7B(1+r)%5Et%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_t"> is the payment in year <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r"> is the interest rate (10% or 0.1 in my earlier example). In year 0, when the contract begins, any money paid immediately is worth the full amount. But as the years go by, the money paid in future years is worth less in NPV terms because we forfeit the opportunity to invest and grow our money in the foregoing years.</p>
<iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQhcp4ff0ZDxRh4BHrC5oQjfmB7UsQW8KfTajvwieJ1AeJ67GmTfbwqFeKYlLVDFxrS-F7_QwGGsC29/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
<p>In the spreadsheet above, I show the calculations of NPV for the entire Shohei deal, as well as for the AAV calculation. Let’s break it down. Starting on the right side of the sheet, which shows the AAV calculation: Shohei will receive $2 million each year that he plays, then for 9 years after that will not receive any more compensation for that year of play, until finally after 10 years he receives the $68 million he is owed. Based on this schedule of payments, I use the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093184?hl=en">Google Sheets NPV function</a> to calculate an AAV of $44 million (I am not sure why I come to a slightly different value than The Athletic, but the figures are close enough). What you can not see in the spreadsheet is one crucial input to the NPV function, the interest rate. I have used an interest rate of 4.43%, and will discuss that choice of rate in a little bit.</p>
<p>Now on the left side of the sheet, I compare the “$700 million 10 year” Shohei deal under two different cash flow scenarios: Scenario B, where $70 million is paid each year for 10 years, AKA what I thought was happening when the deal was announced on Saturday, and Scenario A, the actual deal with heavy deferrals. I have calculated the NPV for both deals, which at a 4.43% interest rate is $365 million for Scenario A, and $555 for Scenario B. In other words, the NPV of the actual deal is only 66% of what I thought it was when the deal was initially announced. In the weeks leading up to the deal, I think many people were expecting something like 10 years $500 million with a conventional payment schedule, and so we can see that in NPV terms the actual deal was much closer to expectations. Still a historic deal, but not quite as record smashing as initially reported.</p>
<p>Now about that interest rate: I have used 4.43% because apparently this is the rate that MLB will use. Lone Star Ball <a href="https://www.lonestarball.com/2023/12/11/23996986/deferred-money-mlb-luxury-competitive-balance-tax-shohei-ohtani-los-angeles-dodgers-cba">has covered the issue well</a>, showing that in the collective bargaining agreement it is stated that the interest rate used for calculating NPV in AAV is the “Federal mid-term rate” as calculated by the IRS, which according to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-23-18.pdf">this document</a> is 4.43%. Now is a good time to mention that the interest rate to use in these sorts of analyses is a very contentious issue. For instance, the US federal government recently announced that it would change the rate used in its analysis of federal regulations from a range of 3-7% to 2%, and this was <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/epi-comment-re-proposed-omb-circular-no-a-4-regulatory-analysis/">widely commented on</a> by many economists and institutions and not without controversy. But even in lower stakes situations such as baseball, it is not always easy to know what rate to use. The problem is related to the concept of financial risk, as you can generally earn a higher interest rate if you are willing to make riskier investments. In essence, if the owners of the Dodgers are willing to take on the necessary risk to earn interest on their investments of greater than 4.43%, then this Shohei deal will mean that the $45 million AAV is a very good deal for them in terms of avoiding baseball’s Competitive Balance Tax.</p>

  <title>On Consistency in the CFP</title>
  <dc:creator>Zander Gordan</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.zandergordan.com/posts/on-consistency/on-consistency.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I do not believe that the College Football Playoff committee has a consistent system for determining its rankings of the top teams for inclusion in the playoffs.</p>
<p>I am a Florida State fan, so I am obviously biased and outraged by the committee’s decision to exclude my team from the playoff. The talking heads on ESPN have today framed the committee’s decision in terms of two competing selection criteria: the best teams versus the most deserving teams. But I will argue that the committee has failed to consistently commit to one or the other of these criteria, and what results is a non-transparent, unsatisfying compromise.</p>
<p>Today an undefeated Power 5 conference champion has been left out of the playoffs, in favor of a 1-loss SEC champion. Those who support this decision justify it by saying that it represents a movement by the committee towards truly selecting the best 4 teams, rather than the 4 most deserving teams. They argue, if Alabama were to play FSU next week, who would be considered the favorite? I agree that Alabama would be the favorite. But how consistent has the committee been in applying this logic? Not very, in my opinion.</p>
<p>My case in point is their relative rankings of #2 Washington and #6 Georgia. If UW and UGA were to play next week, who would be favored? I think Georgia is the clear answer. I am not a sports stats guy, so I am not especially confident in that prediction, but that is my understanding. So the committee thinks a 1-loss Alabama gets in over an undefeated (albeit Jordan Travis-less) FSU, but is not willing to go so far as to also knock out undefeated (still Penix-led) Washington in favor of UGA. It’s about the 4 best teams, until it isn’t. If the college football establishment really wanted to put the 4 best teams in, then a data-driven statistical modelling exercise would be the obvious way to do it. Let Vegas do it! But that won’t be happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>So I think the committee is not really pursuing the 4 best teams. But they are also excluding a very deserving FSU team. To better understand what is driving the committee, I think it is useful to consider a counterfactual: what if everything played out as it did this weekend, except Georgia got 1 extra touchdown to get the win over Alabama? Then I think it is clear the rankings would be #1 UGA, #2 UM, #3 UW, #4 FSU, #5 UT. There would be 4 undefeated power 5 champs, and 1-loss big-12 champ Texas. I think in that scenario FSU gets the nod over Texas. But note that if that’s true, then the relative ranking of FSU versus Texas was determined by the outcome of the SEC championship. In economics we have a concept called the independence of irrelevant alternatives, which would hold that it is irrational for a contest between third parties to affect your rankings of two other teams. So I think this is another example of how the committee has been inconsistent. Admittedly, we can not observe the counterfactual, and I may be wrong, the committee may have selected Texas in that scenario, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I think it is clear that the committee is not really attempting to put the best 4 teams in the playoff. And I would argue that that should not be their goal anyway. With an expanded 12 team playoff coming next season, it will be interesting to see if the playoff committee elects to make any changes in their rules and guidelines for selecting the best teams. I think we should all be able to agree that putting the statistically, by-the-numbers best 12 teams into the playoff is not desirable. We would, for instance, want an undefeated SMU or other non power-5 team to have a shot at a playoff berth, and we do not want a playoff picture entirely dominated by the SEC and the Big 10.</p>
<p>I do not have any one particular solution. I would say that we should all think more deeply about what “most deserving” means. If, in the future with Oregon and Washington leaving the Pac-12 we have to consider, say, a 1-loss Pac-12 Champion Arizona team against a couple 2 loss SEC or Big 10 teams for the last playoff spot, which will we think moreso deserves the spot? I think college football could learn something from the UEFA champions league. More objectivity would certainly welcome, though it is challenging to achieve given the large number of teams and conferences, but this is precisely what UEFA deals with as well, though they have the advantage of being able to play more games in a year.</p>
<p>Go Noles.</p>

  <title>On EBINLO</title>

<p>I have been substantially more musically active this year than I have been any time since about 2014. Grad school is mostly to blame for the long lull, but with my PhD officially conferred in January of this year, I have had more time to devote to hobbies. I’ve adopted a new moniker, EBINLO, for this new round of activity.</p>
<p>There have been a couple of original productions made with a hybrid Ableton and Eurorack setup:</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1911763465/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://ebinlo.bandcamp.com/track/ok-im-up-now-what">OK I&#39;m Up, Now What by EBINLO</a></iframe>

<p>And a couple of DJ mixes focusing on indie pop tunes I found on Bandcamp, made with Ableton Live in the arrangement view, making heavy use of track automation to make the transitions:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1444759837&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ebinlo" title="EBINLO" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">EBINLO</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ebinlo/ebinlo-presents" title="EBINLO Presents" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">EBINLO Presents</a></div>

<p>But mostly I have just been jamming, coming up with stuff and then tearing it down and deleting it within the same day. I hope to put more mixes together, integrating the Eurorack setup into the creation of the mixes as well, and spanning a wider range of genres than just pop. Maybe I would make some more original tracks as well, but that is less interesting to me at the moment.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>With kickoff rapidly approaching for The Game, and my precious Noles set to play their first full game without QB Jordan Travis this season, I wanted to crystallize what I have assimilated regarding success in football, <em>and perhaps, in life</em>.</p>
<p>You’ve got to be physical.</p>
<p>You’ve got to bring pressure.</p>
<p>You’ve got to believe. I learned that from my court-ordered viewership of Ted Lasso.</p>
<p>This is a tricky one: you’ve got give 110%. Some of the two sport athletes may be concerned with “not trying to do too much,” but this is not baseball.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you’ve got to not lose. The mathematically inclined among you may believe that exactly as many games are won as are lost. But spiritually, more games are lost than won. The key, therefore, is not to lose.</p>

<p>Tonight I set up my first Quarto blog, I had previously used blogdown but was never consistent about it, and have since deleted the site. Maybe this time I will be more consistent in posting.</p>
<p>Expected topics to include economics, public policy, sports, music, and life. Possibly, though not definitely, in that order.</p>
