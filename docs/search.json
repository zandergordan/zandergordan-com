    "text": "I have been substantially more musically active this year than I have been any time since about 2014. Grad school is mostly to blame for the long lull, but with my PhD officially conferred in January of this year, I have had more time to devote to hobbies. I’ve adopted a new moniker, EBINLO, for this new round of activity.\nThere have been a couple of original productions made with a hybrid Ableton and Eurorack setup:\n&lt;a href=\"https://ebinlo.bandcamp.com/track/ok-im-up-now-what\"&gt;OK I&#39;m Up, Now What by EBINLO&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://ebinlo.bandcamp.com/track/attention-customers-please-excuse-the-smell\"&gt;Attention Customers Please Excuse The Smell by EBINLO&lt;/a&gt;\nAnd a couple of DJ mixes focusing on indie pop tunes I found on Bandcamp, made with Ableton Live in the arrangement view, making heavy use of track automation to make the transitions:\nEBINLO · EBINLO Presents\nEBINLO · EBINLO Presents Vol 2\nBut mostly I have just been jamming, coming up with stuff and then tearing it down and deleting it within the same day. I hope to put more mixes together, integrating the Eurorack setup into the creation of the mixes as well, and spanning a wider range of genres than just pop. Maybe I would make some more original tracks as well, but that is less interesting to me at the moment."

    "text": "With kickoff rapidly approaching for The Game, and my precious Noles set to play their first full game without QB Jordan Travis this season, I wanted to crystallize what I have assimilated regarding success in football, and perhaps, in life.\nYou’ve got to be physical.\nYou’ve got to bring pressure.\nYou’ve got to believe. I learned that from my court-ordered viewership of Ted Lasso.\nThis is a tricky one: you’ve got give 110%. Some of the two sport athletes may be concerned with “not trying to do too much,” but this is not baseball.\nMost importantly, you’ve got to not lose. The mathematically inclined among you may believe that exactly as many games are won as are lost. But spiritually, more games are lost than won. The key, therefore, is not to lose."

Maybe this time I will be more consistent in posting.\nExpected topics to include economics, public policy, sports, music, and life. Possibly, though not definitely, in that order.\nHere’s a photo of my dog Cannoli:"

    "text": "My name is Zander. This website houses my personal blog.\nI sometimes produce electronic music under the name EBINLO, and also make DJ mixes.\nI’m also a big sports fan, my allegiances are as follows, in descending order of emotional investment:\nIn college football: FSU Seminoles\nIn MLB: ATL Braves\nIn Women’s soccer: FSU Seminoles\nIn English soccer: Everton\nIn European soccer: Whatever Scottish teams have made the champions and europa league that year, meaning generally the Old Firm as well as Hearts and others.\nIn MLS: ATL UTD\nIn any international competition: USA\nIn any other college athletics: FSU Seminoles\nI am not invested in NFL/NBA/NHL, but still watch and sometimes bet a $ or 2 on them for entertainment (I don’t bet on sports I actually care about, I use it strictly as a commitment device to have something to root for).\nBy trade, I am an economist, currently employed as a contractor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in the fisheries division. I may sometimes share my thoughts on matters of economics and public policy, though I will steadfastly avoid any discussion of fisheries or fisheries-adjacent issues, and I need to be clear that nothing published on this site represents an official NOAA or government opinion, it is all strictly my personal content, created in my spare time and not funded by, reviewed by, or in any way connected with my employment."
