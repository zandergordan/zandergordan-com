## Intro

-   What are economists' two roles? How do they differ?\
-   What are models? How do economists use them?\
-   What are the elements of the Circular-Flow Diagram? What concepts does the diagram illustrate?\
-   How is the Production Possibilities Frontier related to opportunity cost? What other concepts does it illustrate?\
-   What is the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics?\
-   What is the difference between positive and normative statements?

## The Economist as a Scientist -- 1

-   Economists play two roles:
    -   **Scientists**: try to explain the world\
    -   **Policy advisers**: try to improve it\
-   As scientists, economists employ the **scientific method**:
    -   Dispassionate development and testing of theories\
    -   Devise theories, collect data, and analyze data to verify or refute theories

## The Economist as a Scientist -- 2

-   **Scientific method in economics**:
    -   Observation → collect and analyze data\
    -   Develop a theory based on observed data\
    -   More observation → evaluate the theory\
-   Cannot use lab experiments → rely on **natural experiments** offered by history

## The Economist as a Scientist -- 3

-   Economists make **assumptions**
    -   Simplify the complex world\
-   Economists use **models**
    -   Built with assumptions\
    -   Omit many details → focus on essentials\
    -   All models are subject to revision

## The Circular-Flow Diagram

-   Visual model of the economy\
-   Shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms\
-   Two decision makers:
    -   **Households**\
    -   **Firms**\
-   Interact in two markets:
    -   Market for goods & services\
    -   Market for factors of production

## The Circular-Flow Diagram

## The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)

-   Graph showing combinations of outputs an economy can produce\
-   Given:
    -   Available factors of production\
    -   Available technology

## The PPF - linear

## The PPF - bowed outwards (increasing OC)

### Areas of the PPF

-   **Efficient**: points on the PPF \
-   **Inefficient**: points inside the PPF\
-   **Not feasible**: points outside the PPF

## Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics

-   **Microeconomics**: decisions of households & firms; interaction in markets\
-   **Macroeconomics**: economy-wide phenomena (inflation, unemployment, growth)

## The Economist as Policy Adviser

-   Economists as scientists: explain events (positive statements)\
-   Economists as advisers: recommend policies (normative statements)

## Positive vs. Normative

-   **Positive statements**: descriptive, testable
    -   "Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment."\
-   **Normative statements**: prescriptive, value-based
    -   "The government should raise the minimum wage."

## Why Economists Disagree

-   Conflicting theories\
-   Different value judgments\
-   Yet, many propositions most economists agree on

## Propositions Economists Agree On

-   Rent ceilings reduce housing availability (93%)\
-   Tariffs & quotas reduce welfare (93%)\
-   US should not restrict outsourcing (90%)\
-   Eliminate farm subsidies (85%)\
-   Eliminate sports franchise subsidies (85%)\
-   Cash \> in-kind transfers (84%)\
-   Large deficits harm economy (83%)\
-   Don't ban GM crops (82%)\
-   Minimum wage increases unemployment (79%)\
-   Reduce ethanol subsidies (78%)

## Summary

-   Economists as **scientists** → assumptions & models (e.g., PPF, circular flow)\
-   **Micro** = individual decision-making; **Macro** = whole economy\
-   **Positive** = descriptive, **Normative** = prescriptive\
-   Economists may **disagree** (judgments, values)\
-   Policymakers may **ignore** advice due to politics
