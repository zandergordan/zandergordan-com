## Welcome

**What is economics?**

::: fragment
**Mankiw's definition:** The study of how society manages its scarce resources.

**Mine:** Economics is what economists do (Jacob Viner)
:::

## Principle 1

**People Face Trade-offs**

-   “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”

-   Choosing one thing means giving up something else.

## Principle 2

**The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It**

-   Opportunity cost is central.

-   Includes both explicit and implicit costs.

## Principle 3

**Rational People Think at the Margin**

-   "Rational people systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their goals"

    -   Note that economists are generally concerned with fixed goals

<!-- -->

-   Decisions are made by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.

-   Example: deciding whether to study one more hour.

## Principle 4

**People Respond to Incentives**

-   Behavior changes when costs or benefits change.

-   Policies must account for incentives.

## Principle 5

**Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**

-   Specialization and exchange increase overall welfare.

    -   “The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market.” - Smith

-   Applies to individuals, firms, and nations.

## Principle 6

**Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity**

-   “Invisible hand” of prices guides resources to efficient uses.

    -   "Prices are a signal wrapped in an incentive" - Tabarrok and Cowen, paraphrasing Hayek

-   Decentralized decision-making often outperforms central planning.

## Principle 7

**Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes**

-   Enforce property rights.

-   Address market failures (e.g., externalities, monopoly).

-   Promote equity alongside efficiency.

## Principle 8

**A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods & Services**

-   Productivity is the key driver of long-run growth.

-   Human capital, technology, and institutions matter.

## Principle 9

**Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money**

-   Inflation is linked to excessive money supply growth.

-   Historical cases: hyperinflation episodes. See Zimbabwe '08, Argentina '89, Weimar Germany

## Principle 10

**Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off Between Inflation and Unemployment**

-   The Phillips Curve (short run).

-   Policies can reduce unemployment temporarily at the cost of higher inflation.
