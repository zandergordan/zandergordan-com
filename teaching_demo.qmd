## Welcome

## Objectives

By the end of today you should be able to:

1.  **Define** GDP growth vs. real GDP per capita (economic) growth.
2.  **Relate** economic growth to the PPF.
3.  **Explain** why economic growth is important.
4.  **Evaluate** *critiques* of growth.

## Measuring Growth

-   **GDP** (market value of final goods & services).
-   **Real GDP** (adjusts for inflation).
-   **Real GDP per capita** (income per person).
-   Growth rate = %Δ over time.

Economic growth = GDP growth - inflation - population growth

## Growth as an Outward PPF Shift

Drivers: **Capital (K)**, **Labor (L)**, **Technology (A)**

## Declines in Violent Crime

## Critiques of Growth

| Perspective | Core Claim |
|----|----|
| **Anti‑consumerist** | Endless consumption erodes well‑being and virtue. |
| **Environmental (Degrowth)** | Infinite growth on a finite planet is impossible; prioritize ecology. |
| **Inequality** | Average growth hides rising gaps; *who* benefits matters. |

## Addressing the Critiques

-   **Green innovation** (cheaper clean energy).
-   **Inclusive institutions** that spread gains.

## Key Take‑Aways

1.  Economic growth drove the “hockey‑stick” rise in income *and* life expectancy.
2.  Growth = PPF shift powered by capital, labor, and—above all—technology.
3.  Growth has trade‑offs: environment, inequality, culture.
4.  Policy challenge: **sustain, enhance, and distribute** future growth.

## Exit Ticket

*Pick one dividend of economic growth that you think is most important. Pick one drawback you think most important.*
