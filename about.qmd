My name is Zander. This website houses my personal blog. It contains miscellaneous observations and musings on any and all topics which I might feel like writing about.

By trade I am an economist, you can see my research profile on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BFc4yhMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

As of Fall 2025 I am joining the faculty at Georgia College, having previously spent the initial 5 years of my career after grad school working for ECS Federal on a contract supporting NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center on issues related to recreational fishing.

I am an avid musician, specializing in the use of modular sound design and composition tools including a fledgling Eurorack system interfaced with Bitwig, and sometimes also Max/MSP. I was an Ableton user since 2012, then started the eurorack system in 2023, which prompted the switch to Bitwig in 2024.

I'm also a big sports fan, my allegiances are as follows, in descending order of emotional investment:

1.  In college football: FSU Seminoles
2.  In MLB: ATL Braves
3.  In Women's soccer: FSU Seminoles
4.  In English soccer: Everton
5.  In European soccer: Whatever Scottish teams have made the champions and europa league that year, meaning generally the Old Firm as well as Hearts and others.
6.  In MLS: ATL UTD
7.  In any international competition: USA
8.  In any other college athletics: FSU Seminoles

I am not invested in NFL/NBA/NHL, but still watch occasionally.
