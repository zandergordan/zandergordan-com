My name is Zander. This website houses my personal blog.

I sometimes produce electronic music under the name [EBINLO](ebinlo.com), and also make DJ mixes.

I'm also a big sports fan, my allegiances are as follows, in descending order of emotional investment:

In college football: FSU Seminoles

In MLB: ATL Braves

In Women's soccer: FSU Seminoles

In English soccer: Everton

In European soccer: Whatever Scottish teams have made the champions and europa league that year, meaning generally the Old Firm as well as Hearts and others.

In MLS: ATL UTD

In any international competition: USA

In any other college athletics: FSU Seminoles

I am not invested in NFL/NBA/NHL, but still watch and sometimes bet a \$ or 2 on them for entertainment (I don't bet on sports I actually care about, I use it strictly as a commitment device to have something to root for).

By trade, I am an economist, currently employed as a contractor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in the fisheries division. I may sometimes share my thoughts on matters of economics and public policy, though I will steadfastly avoid any discussion of fisheries or fisheries-adjacent issues, and I need to be clear that nothing published on this site represents an official NOAA or government opinion, it is all strictly my personal content, created in my spare time and not funded by, reviewed by, or in any way connected with my employment.
