I had a wonderful 30th birthday party yesterday, thank you to all who attended, and to those who were unable to make it I hope to see you soon.

I do not necessarily feel much older. I am however very much looking forward to the future: in case anyone had not yet heard, I am joining the economics faculty at Georgia College.

I have released some music lately, I put it on streaming but I think going forward I will just have it here on the website.
