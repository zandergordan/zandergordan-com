![Visual branding for Zohran compaign, to be carried over into retail operation?](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-12.04.39%E2%80%AFPM.png)

I observe that one of the hard parts of running a competitive business is getting customers in the door.

I observe that having a strong brand, social media following, etc is a great asset in getting customers in the door.

I observe that the proposed NYC-run grocery stores which Zohran campaigned on are likely to be understood, both by supporters and critics, as an extension of the man himself.

I observe that the Mamdani campaign was highly successful, leveraging a strong social media strategy and visual branding into an improbable win.

I conclude that Zohran-Mart has a better chance of successful operation than perhaps most of my colleagues are willing to consider.

The obvious point that my fellow economists will raise against my conclusion is that, lacking a profit motive, the government-run stores will be unlikely to achieve the necessary level of cost containment.

But there is nothing in economics that says that state-run enterprises cannot operate efficiently, the standard result is rather that competitive pressures create a selection effect where most privately run enterprises operating at a given point in time will be operating efficiently, because they are the ones who are surviving.

It is true that grocery stores tend to operate thin profit margins, but this partially reflects that it is ultimately a somewhat simple business. I envision Zohran-Mart as an Aldi-style minimalist discount retailer, with perhaps a visual upgrade borrowing from the design sensibility which was on display in the campaign.

Trips to Zohran-Mart will almost certainly be cataloged and posted on social media, with a level of interest that will surely be the envy of every other grocer operating in the NYC area. This could of course be a liability if the stores are poorly run. But if the Mayor can manage to poach sufficient talent from the private sector to do a respectable job with the state-run option, I think it is entirely possible that the stores turn out to be a success.

Why do I bring this up? Most Mamdani commentary I have seen from people I respect has included passing, knee-jerk style derogatory comments about the absurdity of the NYC-run grocery idea. I worry about the profession losing yet further credibility in the eyes of the public if Zohran-Mart turns out to be a highly visible success story. No doubt this could lend cover to his other, much more troubling positions on other issues such as housing.

Perhaps I am overthinking it. But consider this my bold prediction for 2026, we will see if I can come up with any others before the year is out.
